    // This comment is duplicated in the unit test for this method.
    // It turns out that an XMLHttpRequest object has no method for getting the
    //   values of request headers once they have been set. See the docs, where
    //   there are methods for setting request headers and getting response
    //   headers, but no methods for getting request headers:
    //   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest
    // I'd still like to test that the signature is being generated, but I can't
    //   directly get the values of headers from the XHR object.
    // So, I'm going to return an object from this method that contains both the
    //   XHR object itself as well as the signature and initialization vector.
    //   This will make it possible to unit test that the signature and
    //   initialization vector are in scope. BUT, we are still
    //   not testing that these values were set in request headers.

    // This all means that the following line of code must not be deleted!
    // If you delete these two lines of code, the tests will still pass, but you
    //   will be sending unsigned requests.
    xhr.setRequestHeader('Authorization', signature);
    xhr.setRequestHeader('IV', initialization_vector);

    // You can manually verify that the Authorization and IV headers are being
    //   set by uncommenting the following line and visually observing that the
    //   Authorization and IV headers exist and have strings as their values.
    // console.log(xhr);
