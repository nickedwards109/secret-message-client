    // It turns out that an XMLHttpRequest object has no method for getting the
    //   values of request headers once they have been set. See the docs, where
    //   there are methods for setting request headers and getting response
    //   headers, but no methods for getting request headers:
    //   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest
    // I'd still like to test that the signature is being generated, but I can't
    //   directly get the value of the Authorization header from the XHR object.
    // So, I'm going to return an object from this method that contains both the
    //   XHR object itself as well as the signature. This will make it possible
    //   to unit test that the signature is being generated. BUT, we are still
    //   not testing that the signature was set as a header in the request.
    // You can manually verify that the Authorization header is being set by
    //   uncommenting the following line and visually observing that the
    //   Authorization header exists and has a long string as its value.
    //   console.log(signed_xhr);

    console.log('Want to test more thoroughly that the Authorization header is being set? Uncomment the console.log() above and look for an Authorization header with a long string as its value.')

    // Here, we test that a signature is generated by HTTPClient#sign_request(),
    //  although this does not test that this signature is assigned to an
    //  Authorization header, as per the comments above.
