This is a client-side application that will get secret messages (!!!) which are stored on a remote server.

The API that sends the secret messages will authenticate requests using a SHA-256 Hash-based Message Authentication Code algorithm, and the HTTP response body will be encrypted with the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm. In order for the server to respond with an HTTP 200 response, the request will need to be signed according to the following scheme:

1. The client will have access to a secret key that is practically impossible to guess, and is known to both the client and the server, but is not known to anyone else. This will probably be achieved by setting the key as a [Rails secret key](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7f18ea14c893cb5c9f04d4fda9661126758332b5/railties/lib/rails/tasks/misc.rake#L2) that is stored as an environment variable on the hosts of both the client-side and server-side applications. Ensuring that absolutely nobody else knows the key is outside the scope of this project.
2. The client will generate a digital signature by hashing the request line of its HTTP GET request using an implementation of SHA-256 HMAC and the key from step 1.
3. The client will include an Authorization header in the GET request with the value set as the HMAC resulting from step 2. Unfortunately, we are talking about authentication, not authorization, but it seems to be a web standard to call the header 'Authorization'. See the AWS S3 docs on [Signing and Authenticating REST Requests](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html), which uses a similar scheme.
4. The server will use the same key to generate an HMAC from the request line, and then compare the resulting HMAC to the value of the Authorization header. If they match, the server will conclude that the client has authenticated properly.

This scheme ensures that the client has access to the key, and is thus the entity they say they are. It also ensures that the request has not been tampered with in transit between the client and the server.

If the client does not authenticate successfully, the server will respond with an HTTP 404 Not Found with an empty body (this provides minimal information to a potential attacker).

If the client authenticates successfully, the server will encrypt the requested data using AES-256-CBC and the same key as before. The server will set the resulting string as the body of an HTTP 200 response. The server will also sign the request using steps 1-4 above (with 'client' replaced with 'server' in those steps).

This response format ensures that an attacker who eavesdrops on the request would not be able to retrieve the secret message. It also ensures to the client that the response did indeed come from the correct server and was not tampered with during transit.

When the client receives the response and checks the signature, it will decrypt the data and render it in the browser if the signature is valid, and it will render nothing in the browser if the signature is invalid.
